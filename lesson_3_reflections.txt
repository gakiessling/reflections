When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would use a remote repository if you're collaborating with other people or if you plan to work from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There could be new bugs in the remote repository or your local repository might have some changes that you aren't ready to combine with the remote.
