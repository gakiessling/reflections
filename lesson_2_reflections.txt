What happens when you initialize a reposity? Why do you need to do it?
An empty repository is made and no files are being tracked. You need to establish that you want to start tracking files in the repo location.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is not being tracked yet, but it is marking files to be tracked. It allows you to visualize which files are going to be tracked and which are not.
